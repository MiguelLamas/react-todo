# Modern React ToDo CRUD App

I created this React ToDo app that saves and loads to local storage. The React App includes full CRUD functionality: create, read, update, and delete.

## Main Learning Points:

* Building Components in React.
* Passing Props between Components.
* Creating your own Custom Hooks to read and write data to your local storage.
* How to deal with State locally and pass it between Components.
* Working with Heroicons (Beautiful hand-crafted SVG icons, by the makers of Tailwind CSS).
* Accessibility (aria-label, color theory)
* Working with Vite JS.
* 


## Built with:

* React.js
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Vite JS
* HTML
* CSS

## Deployed with:

* Deployed using Netlify
